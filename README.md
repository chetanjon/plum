# Moai

The AI-native dynamic island for Mac. Incumbents treat the notch as a widget shelf. Moai's rule: **everything you put on the island can be asked about.**

The name: real moai are buried up to their shoulders. Ours is buried in the bezel. Only the head shows at the top of your screen, and it surfaces when you hold it. (Also: mo-AI. You heard it.)

## Download

[**Latest release**](https://github.com/chetanjon/moai/releases/latest). Apple Silicon, macOS 14+, free.

First open: macOS will ask once. System Settings, Privacy and Security, Open Anyway. Moai is unsigned because it is free and independent. Speech recognition is Apple standard dictation, there are no API keys anywhere, and beyond the optional Chat tab, Moai asks the internet only for: whether a newer version exists (a daily check against GitHub releases, switchable off in Settings), album art for what you play, and favicons for sites you save, each fetched from its own source, never through a third-party service.

## v1 feature set

**Do** (the core surface)
- Hold the notch and talk, or tap and type. Same engine either way.
- `remind me to call amma at 6` becomes a real Reminder with an alarm.
- `schedule lunch with sarah friday at 1` becomes a real Calendar event.
- `agenda` or `today` drops today's calendar out of the notch.
- `focus 25` starts a pomodoro with synthesized brown noise, countdown live in the notch wing. `stop focus` ends it.
- `timer 10` runs a countdown in the wing.
- `brown noise` / `white noise` / `pink noise`, generated live, no audio files, works offline.
- `note: something` captures locally. `notes` lists. `clear notes` wipes.
- `play`, `pause`, `skip`, `previous` control music.
- Dates parsed deterministically with NSDataDetector. Verbs by prefix. Zero network, zero key, instant.
- Anything beyond the verbs goes to the Mac's own on-device model, keyless. Long conversations belong to the Chat tab and your own subscription.

**Voice**
- Hold to talk or tap the mic; recognition is Apple standard dictation, on-device when the model is warm, Apple dictation service otherwise, the same path Notes and Messages use. Your music ducks while you speak.

**Music**
- Whatever plays, anywhere: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube in a browser, any app the system hears. While playing, the closed island stays bare and a breathing album-color rim carries the signal; expand for artwork, transport, and scrubbing.
- The opened island comes in two materials, ink or liquid glass, in Settings under Life. Closed, it is always ink; melting into the notch is its job.

**Clips** (clipboard history)
- Last 30 copies. Password-manager copies (concealed/transient) never stored.
- Brow glyph on any clip attaches it to Do: summarize, rewrite, translate.

**Shelf** (file drop)
- Drag files onto the notch, drag out, copy, or share.
- Brow glyph on PDFs and text files: attach contents and question them.

**Chat** (bring your own subscription)
- A small built-in browser under the notch pointing at Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini; pick the service in Settings.
- You sign in with your own account, once; nothing is scraped, proxied, or automated, and no API key is involved.
- Moai is not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google.

**Deliberately cut:** webcam mirror, notes-as-panel, wallpapers, widget packs, agent monitoring.

## Permission prompts, in order of appearance

macOS will ask once each for: Microphone + Speech Recognition (first hold-to-talk), Reminders (first remind), Calendars (first schedule/agenda), Automation for Spotify/Music (when music first plays; asked up front if your player is already open during the welcome tour). All expected, approve them.

## Run it (on your Mac)

Needs macOS 14+ and Xcode installed.

```bash
brew install xcodegen
cd moai
xcodegen
open Moai.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode: select your personal team under Signing & Capabilities, then hit Run.

First music control triggers a macOS Automation permission prompt (Moai → Spotify/Music). Approve it once.

### Or let Claude Code do it

Open this folder in Claude Code and paste:

> Generate the Xcode project with xcodegen, build the Moai scheme, and fix any compile errors you hit, then run it. Do not change the design, architecture, feature scope, or the Design law section of the README. Test each verb from the README v1 feature list and fix what fails.

## Architecture (30 seconds)

- `NotchWindowController`: borderless non-activating NSPanel at status-bar level, measured against the real notch via `NSScreen.safeAreaInsets` + auxiliary top areas, re-measured through every display change. Global click monitor collapses the island.
- `NotchViewModel`: island state, active tab, and the context handoff (`askAbout`) that lets clips and files flow into the Do surface.
- `Features/`: MediaRemoteBridge + MusicController (system-wide now-playing via the vendored adapter, AppleScript enrichment for Spotify/Music extras), ClipboardStore (pasteboard polling, 1s, text and images), ShelfStore (drops, AirDrop, PDF/text extraction via PDFKit), NotesStore, ShortcutStore, VoiceController, FocusController.
- `Views/`: NotchRootView (the morphing shape, ink and glass materials, drop target, wings), ExpandedView (tabs + Do), IslandRows (the media row), SettingsPane.
- `AIService`: Apple's on-device model for quick answers and verb translation, keyless.

## Known trade-offs

- Now-playing rides a vendored MediaRemote adapter (BSD-3) loaded through `/usr/bin/perl`; if a future macOS closes that door, the app falls back to AppleScript polling for Spotify and Apple Music only.
- No conversation memory in ask, each question is fresh. Long conversations belong to the Chat tab.
- No global hotkey, by choice: every summon key collided with something. Hover, the mic, or the typed bar open the island.
- Unsigned; the first open needs one Open Anyway.

## Roadmap

- **v1.5:** Messages sending, menu bar countdown.
- **v2:** meeting brief before your next call, screen context.
- Distribution: Homebrew cask; a notarized build if enrollment ever earns its $99. The landing page is [live](https://chetanjon.github.io/moai/).
