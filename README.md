# Plum

The AI-native dynamic island for Mac. Incumbents treat the notch as a widget shelf. Plum's rule: **everything you put on the island can be asked about.**

The name: a plum is a small dark rounded thing that hangs just where you can reach it. So is the pill at the top of your screen. A little plum on your Apple; hold it and it answers.

## Download

[**Download Plum.zip**](https://github.com/chetanjon/plum/releases/latest/download/Plum.zip), always the newest build. Apple Silicon, macOS 14+, free, MIT-licensed. (Release notes live on the [releases page](https://github.com/chetanjon/plum/releases/latest).) Or through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask chetanjon/plum/plum
```

Unzip, drag Plum to Applications, open it. First open: macOS will ask once. System Settings, Privacy and Security, Open Anyway. Plum is unsigned because it is free and independent. After that, updates take care of themselves: the island mentions a new version once, and one click installs it in place and relaunches (Sparkle, with updates signed by the project's own key; no browser, no re-download dance). Speech recognition is Apple standard dictation, there are no API keys anywhere, and beyond the optional Chat tab, Plum asks the internet only for: whether a newer version exists (a daily check, switchable off in Settings), the update itself when you say yes, album art for what you play, and favicons for sites you save, each fetched from its own source, never through a third-party service. The Live status API listens on localhost only; nothing it hears leaves the machine.

## v1 feature set

**Do** (the core surface)
- Hold the notch and talk, or tap and type. Same engine either way.
- `remind me to call amma at 6` becomes a real Reminder with an alarm.
- `schedule lunch with sarah friday at 1` becomes a real Calendar event.
- `agenda` or `today` drops today's calendar out of the notch. `join` opens the next meeting's video link (Zoom, Meet, Teams, Webex, FaceTime); the Today rows carry a tap-to-join chip, and the glance marks a joinable meeting with a small camera.
- `focus 25` starts a pomodoro with synthesized brown noise, its progress ring live beside the notch. `stop focus` ends it.
- `timer 10` runs a countdown, its ring beside the notch. `stopwatch` counts up; `stop stopwatch` holds the reading on screen, `stopwatch` again rolls on, `reset stopwatch` clears. Also a chip in the Focus tab, with pause and reset buttons.
- `how much time left` reads the running sessions back; `cancel the timer` and its article-carrying kin stop the right thing, honestly ("No timer running." when there is none).
- Running sessions mark the closed pill with a small symbol (the progress ring, or a stopwatch glyph), never digits; numbers live in the open island.
- `brown noise` / `white noise` / `pink noise`, generated live, no audio files, works offline.
- `note: something` captures locally. `notes` lists. `clear notes` wipes.
- `play`, `pause`, `skip`, `previous` control music. `what's playing` names the track and where it plays; `volume up`, `turn the volume down a bit`, or `volume 30` turn the same knob the row's slider does (the player's own volume when it has one, the Mac's otherwise).
- `text amma: on my way` or `tell amma i'm on my way` reads the message back; only the word `send` fires it, as an iMessage through Messages. Nothing ever sends unconfirmed, and any other command drops the staged text. (`tell me ...` stays a question.)
- Dates parsed deterministically with NSDataDetector. Verbs by prefix. Zero network, zero key, instant.
- `read my screen` captures the front window, runs on-device OCR (Vision, keyless), and attaches the words as context for your next question; `summarize my screen` does it and answers in one breath; explain, describe, translate, and tldr lead the same way (`translate my screen to hindi`). Nothing is stored, nothing leaves the Mac; needs one Screen Recording yes.
- `what's new` reads the latest release notes right in the island.
- Anything beyond the verbs goes to the Mac's own on-device model, keyless. Long conversations belong to the Chat tab and your own subscription.

**Voice**
- Hold to talk or tap the mic; recognition is Apple standard dictation, on-device when the model is warm, Apple dictation service otherwise, the same path Notes and Messages use. Your music ducks while you speak.

**Music**
- Whatever plays, anywhere: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube in a browser, any app the system hears. While playing, the pill stays bare and a breathing album-color rim carries the signal; a small wave can dance beside the notch if you switch it on. Expand for artwork, transport, and scrubbing. Wave, rim, and the session mark each have their own switch in Settings, so the closed pill can be exactly as lively or as bare as you like.
- With music and a session running together, the wave keeps the left wing and the session mark crosses to the right.
- The opened island comes in two materials, ink or liquid glass, in Settings under Life. Closed, it is always ink; melting into the notch is its job.
- On a notchless monitor the collapsed island shows nothing at rest; the top edge still opens it on hover. One thing counts as a reason to surface briefly: a passing toast (a timer finishing, an update landing). It lives six seconds and clears itself.

**Clips** (clipboard history)
- Last 30 copies. Password-manager copies (concealed/transient) never stored.
- Brow glyph on any clip attaches it to Do: summarize, rewrite, translate.

**Shelf** (file drop)
- Drag files onto the notch, drag out, copy, or share.
- Brow glyph on PDFs and text files: attach contents and question them.

**Live status** (the open door)
- Anything on your Mac can put a status pill on the island: `curl localhost:4242/activity -d '{"id":"deploy","title":"Deploying","state":"working"}'`. States: `working`, `needs-input`, `done`, `failed`, `clear`; `GET /activities` lists, `DELETE /activity/<id>` clears. Loopback only, never leaves the machine.
- `scripts/plum` wraps it for humans and scripts: `plum working "Deploying"`, `plum needs-input "Waiting on you"`, `plum done "Build finished"`, `plum clear`. Copy it into your PATH if you like it.
- Made for the things that have no home: build scripts, deploys, renders, long downloads. The open island lists them attention-first (needs-input wears the accent); the closed pill never grows for any of it, and finished things fade on their own. Nothing posts unless you point it here.

**Chat** (bring your own subscription)
- A small built-in browser under the notch pointing at Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini; pick the service in Settings.
- You sign in with your own account, once; nothing is scraped, proxied, or automated, and no API key is involved.
- Plum is not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google.

**Deliberately cut:** webcam mirror, notes-as-panel, wallpapers, widget packs. (Agent monitoring was cut in v1 and un-cut in 1.0.63; the world filled with agents.)

## Permission prompts, in order of appearance

macOS will ask once each for: Microphone + Speech Recognition (first hold-to-talk), Reminders (first remind), Calendars (first schedule/agenda), Contacts (first text, so the name you say finds its number), Automation for Spotify/Music (when music first plays; asked up front if your player is already open during the welcome tour), Automation for Messages (staging your first text), and Screen Recording (first "read my screen"; may need a relaunch to take). All expected, approve them.

## Run it (on your Mac)

Needs macOS 14+ and Xcode installed.

```bash
brew install xcodegen
cd plum
xcodegen
open Plum.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode: select your personal team under Signing & Capabilities, then hit Run. `xcodebuild test -scheme Plum` runs the unit suite (the parsing rules, version comparator, and session grammar that were each paid for live).

First music control triggers a macOS Automation permission prompt (Plum → Spotify/Music). Approve it once.

### Or let Claude Code do it

Open this folder in Claude Code and paste:

> Generate the Xcode project with xcodegen, build the Plum scheme, and fix any compile errors you hit, then run it. Do not change the design, architecture, feature scope, or the Design law section of the README. Test each verb from the README v1 feature list and fix what fails. For the texting verb, stage and drop only: never say send, and never send a message to anyone.

## Architecture (30 seconds)

- `NotchWindowController`: borderless non-activating NSPanel at status-bar level, measured against the real notch via `NSScreen.safeAreaInsets` + auxiliary top areas, re-measured through every display change. Global click monitor collapses the island.
- `NotchViewModel`: island state, active tab, and the context handoff (`askAbout`) that lets clips and files flow into the Do surface.
- `Features/`: MediaRemoteBridge + MusicController (system-wide now-playing via the vendored adapter, AppleScript enrichment for Spotify/Music extras), EventKitService (reminders and calendar, deterministic date parsing), ClipboardStore (pasteboard polling, 1s, text and images), ShelfStore (drops, AirDrop, PDF/text extraction via PDFKit), ActivityStore + ActivityServer (the localhost:4242 status door), MessageCourier (stage, read back, send only on "send"), UpdateChecker (the quiet daily version check; Sparkle does the in-place install when you say yes), NotesStore, ShortcutStore, VoiceController, FocusController.
- `Views/`: NotchRootView (the morphing shape, ink and glass materials, drop target, wings), ExpandedView (tabs + Do), IslandRows (the media row), SettingsPane.
- `AIService`: Apple's on-device model for quick answers and verb translation, keyless.

## Design law

The rules every round is built under, in the order they were paid for:

- One way per job. When two surfaces do the same thing, the worse one gets cut.
- No fixed-height voids. The island hugs what it shows.
- Nothing pins the island open. Drafts and staged messages survive collapse instead.
- Closed, the island is ink and melts into the hardware. Materials are for the opened shell.
- Nothing outward-facing fires unconfirmed. A text reads back before it sends.
- Copy tells the truth the moment architecture changes.

## Known trade-offs

- Now-playing rides a vendored MediaRemote adapter (BSD-3) loaded through `/usr/bin/perl`; if a future macOS closes that door, the app falls back to AppleScript polling for Spotify and Apple Music only.
- No conversation memory in ask, each question is fresh. Long conversations belong to the Chat tab.
- No global hotkey, by choice: every summon key collided with something. Hover, the mic, or the typed bar open the island.
- Texting sends over iMessage only. A number that lives on the green side isn't reachable yet; SMS relay is untested ground and stays out until it can be tested honestly.
- Unsigned; the first open needs one Open Anyway.

## Roadmap

- Screen context shipped in 1.0.78, Messages sending in 1.0.66, self-updates in 1.0.86. What remains from the old list: a meeting brief before your next call, still earning its shape. (The menu bar countdown was pruned; the island already carries the countdown on every display, and two surfaces for one number is the kind of thing this app exists to refuse.)
- Distribution: the Homebrew cask is live (`brew install --cask chetanjon/plum/plum`); a notarized build if enrollment ever earns its $99. The landing page is [live](https://chetanjon.github.io/plum/).
